### [Transitive Robotics](https://transitiverobotics.com/)
Full-stack robotic capabilities


We are currently working on the open-source release of the Transitive framework, i.e., the source-code for the Transitive agent that gets installed on devices, as well as the cloud-stack behind transitiverobotics.com. The easiest way to get started with Transitive is to try our hosted solution by requesting an invite to our beta and then try out some of the [capabilities](https://transitiverobotics.com/caps) that have been released so far.
