### [Transitive Robotics](https://transitiverobotics.com/)
An open-source framework for building full-stack robotic capabilities.

Transitive helps robotics companies avoid the [make-vs-buy dilemma of fleet management](https://transitiverobotics.com/blog/make-vs-buy) by offering an alternative: making it a lot easier to build your own fleet management system and cloud portals. It does so by two means: 
 - an [open-source framework](https://github.com/transitiverobotics/transitive) that readily solves many of the hard problems such as reliable world-state synchronization between robot, cloud, and web; authentication & authorization; versioning and over-the-air updates; and cross-device dependency management, and
 - a growing [list of full-stack components](https://transitiverobotics.com/caps), called *capabilities*, that provide required functions such as remote video streaming to the web.

The latter can be embedded in any web application, regardless of whether it was built using Transitive or not. The only requirement is to have the Transitive agent running on the robot.
